Take image
Divide into i=NxM pieces
Distort by changing size
Randomly choose i locations withing a size limit
place pictures on white background
Add noise
store locations and filenames as truth values on json file

Repeat for however many images




To detect
Use existing software??
Image detection+location seems super complicated
get bounding boxes
maybe pass through second network to trim edges
